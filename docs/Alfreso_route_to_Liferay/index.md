## Alfreso - Liferay integration based on Camel / Fuse
This is a Tutorial that extends the [Alfresco Developer Series](https://ecmarchitect.com/alfresco-developer-series) from Jeff Potts which is an essential start if you try to dig into the Alfresco Customization / Developer world.

In that series Jeff builds a scenario where a company, called SomeCo, publishes whitepapers, stored in Alfresco, to an external website. He explains and realizes all the necessary steps on the Alfresco site without actually transporting /managing documents to / in the external repository.

### The route to Liferay
Thinking of [Alfresco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfresco_Software) as the leading Open Source ECM System and [Liferay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liferay) as the leading Portal Server in the JAVA world, an integration of the two is worth thinking about. Actually it has been done many times. For example by using [CMIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_Management_Interoperability_Services). But CMIS seems not to be a rising star anymore and Liferay dropped the CMIS store for a reason.

Both systems follow the "Headless" approach. That means that the GUI and the server logic are getting decoupled and the core functionality is offered by REST services.

Having said that you might think: *OK, let's use these services and connect Alfresco with Liferay. That's no rocket science!*

You surely could. But thinking a little bit further you might want to reuse your connection components. You might want to have some system-independent businesslogic or workflow tooling to make everything part of a business process. Or you may have the need to connect more than two systems to build the solution.

That's where [Apache Camel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Camel) and [Red Hat Fuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuse_ESB) come into the game for designing a shiny middleware.

So I decided to have a closer look...

### About this work
Although the solution that will be build in this tutorial is finally working, it is far from being production ready and might not even always be done in the perfect way. So, if you find anything that can be done better for any reason, don't hesitate to let me know. For example you could raise an [issue](https://github.com/akreienbring/akreienbring.github.io/issues) to start a discussion.

During this turorial you will learn (Quick Access)<br> 
1. [about all the software you need for the turial](softwarestack.md)
2. [how to send ActiveMQ messages from Alfresco to Camel](messagesending.md)
3. [to get started with a Fuse Integration Project](getting_started_fuse.md)
4. [what it needs to download Alfresco content with Camel-CMIS](using_cmis_download.md)
5. [how to upload content to Liferay using REST](upload_content_liferay.md)
6. [to plan integrations by exchanging ID's beetween applications and what CRUD is](prepare_crud.md)
7. [that it needs a special behaviour of Alfreco to implement CRUD](implement_crud.md)
8. [bringing logical choices to routes](making_decisions.md)
9. [how the final route looks like](route_overview.md)

### Part 1: Now let's start working step by step
We will first check what we need for the tutorial to work out. As I said, it absolutely depends on Jeffs [SomeCo tutorial](https://ecmarchitect.com/alfresco-developer-series). If you haven't done it, I recommend starting there and come back later. 
At a minimum go, get and install the tutorial code from [his github repo](https://github.com/jpotts/alfresco-developer-series).

... Welcome back! 

At the very first, I will give you an overview over the main software I used in the process. Needless to say that I guarantee nothing. Nor do I support the things we will create here. It is allways a good idea to check out the respective community Forum if you get stuck.

[Chapter 1: A bunch of tools we need to get up and running](softwarestack.md)

### Part 2: Extending the Alfreso SomeCo Module with an ActiveMQ message sender
Now you survived the *Open Source Version Hell* you've earned a first preview to the route to Liferay.

![The Start of the route](img/start_of_route.png)

We will get back to the details later, but note the ActiveMQ Camel Component at the beginning. That's the entry point to our middleware, to our integration framework. Also note that some properties are extracted from the incoming message. 
This all means that Alfresco has to be able to send such a message.

Follow on with:<br>
[Chapter 2: Sending an ActiveMQ message from Alfresco](messagesending.md)

### Part 3: Consuming ActiveMQ messages with Camel / Fuse
*Even the nicest message fails if nobody wants to hear it.* (If this is a illegal quotation, let me know)

Now on to Fuse! We will set up a *Fuse Integration Project* with Eclipse and start building our route. Our first task is to cope with messages of the form
```
{
	"alfrescoID":"8d03bfbc-ed24-4f96-8c4a-fc8f333b7b37",
	"action":"create"
}
```
which was created by Alfresco and send to ActiveMQ. The message holds the Alfresco document ID (of type whitepaper) and the action that we finally want to perform in Liferay.

[Chapter 3: Getting started with Fuse](getting_started_fuse.md)

### Part 4: Retrieve a document by using Camel-CMIS
Until now we only have the ID of an Alfresco document. The next step is getting our hands on the document object itself. We will use the Camel-CMIS component to achieve this.

During this, it will also be shown how to add Camel components to Fuse which are not in the Fuse palette.

[Chapter 4: Using CMIS to download a document from Alfresco](using_cmis_download.md)

### Part 5: Upload content to Liferay
Using the so called *headless delivery* REST API of Liferay, we are going to upload what we downloaded via CMIS from Alfresco in this chapter.

Using Camel, this is one of the rare spots where a small JAVA bean must be written to achieve what we want.

[Chapter 5: Upload content to Liferay](upload_content_liferay.md)

### Part 6: Prepare yourself for C(R)UD
The document was successfully created in Liferay. That was the "C" of C(R)UD.
That stands for Create-Read-Update-Delete. We don't need to read the document from Liferay in this scenario, but we need to update or delete the created Liferay document when it get's updated or deleted in Alfresco. 

And a fundamental thing here: We need to store Liferay ID's in Alfresco. That needs an update of the content model!

[Chapter 6: Preparations for C(R)UD](prepare_crud.md)

### Part 7: Implementing ActiveMQ Update / Delete messages in Alfresco 
It's time to tweak Alfresco to be able to send update and delete messages besides the create message we worked with until this point of the tutorial.

This will be done by teaching the platform a new behavior, when the corresponding events occur.

[Chapter 7: Implementing the C(R)UD behaviour](implement_crud.md)

### Part 8: Going the last steps on the route to Liferay
Our route need's routing logic because of the new messages. Some kind of *if then else* decisions need to be made. The visual Designer is not allways your friend. Sometimes just some good old copy & past is helpfull.

[Chapter 8: Making decisions on the route ](making_decisions.md)

### Summary
Congratulations! Thank you for following me on the long journey from Alfresco to Liferay. The route we made was sometimes stony. Doing it with Camel / Fuse is surely a lot easier then coding everything yourself. Let me say that the countless languages are a babylonian challenge for newbees! But, on the other hand, once you know how to handle them, this is an extremly powerfull tool!

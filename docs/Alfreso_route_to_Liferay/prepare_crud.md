## Chapter 6.: Preparations for C(R)UD
In the the previous chapter we successfully created a Alfresco document in Liferay. If the document is updated / deleted in Alfresco it must also be updated / deleted in Liferay.
That is the idea of CRUD Create-Read-Update-Delete. 

We don't have to read from Liferay but thinking about Update / Delete it is clear that we need to store the ID of the Liferay document in Alfresco.

## Chapter 3.: Getting started with Fuse
In the previous chapter we learned how we make Alfreso send messages to an ActiveMQ Queue. Now they are  waiting for further processing by Camel / Fuse.

We will set up a Fuse Integration Project with Eclipse and start building our route. Our first task is to cope with messages of the form
```
{
	"alfrescoID":"8d03bfbc-ed24-4f96-8c4a-fc8f333b7b37",
	"action":"create"
}
```
The messages holds the Alfresco document ID (of type whitepaper) and the action that we finally want to perform in Liferay.

## A new Fuse Integration Project
Start your Eclipse IDE and create a new Fuse Integration Project in the workspace.

Click "Next", give the project a name of your choice and click "Next" again. Now this step is important.

Note the selections I made:
Red Had offers you to deploy the Projekt to their Kubernetes / Openshift platform. This is surely a cool thing, but let's run it **standalone**.

For this tutorial, as described in the [Software Stack](softwarestack.md), I'll choose *Wildfly*

Red Hat requires you to *verify* the settings. After that you can click on *finish*. Now sit back and wait or get yourself a drink of your choice. Creating the project takes quite a while.

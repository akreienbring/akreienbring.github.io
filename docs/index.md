Being informed is (almost) always a good thing. Having structured and unstructured data in place when and where it's needed, is crucial for the modern world. 
As the information is often spread over different systems and repositories it is sometimes needed to let applications "talk" with each other.
Thinking in business processes with human and automatic tasks while information gets born, flows, is changed and later deleted or archived? 

Then this place is for you.

## Digging deeper
Looking deeper in some oh-so-fantastic new technology often leaves you with only a few unsatisfying hits doing an internet search when you try to find out how things really work or need to troubleshoot an error.
So I though document my experiences and achievements here could help others.

### Alfresco - Liferay integration based on Camel / Fuse
Let's start with a tutorial that extends the [Alfresco Developer Series](https://ecmarchitect.com/alfresco-developer-series) from Jeff Potts which is an essential start, if you try to dig into the Alfresco Customization / Developer world.

In that series Jeff builds a scenario where a company, called SomeCo, publishes whitepapers, stored in Alfresco, to an external website. He explains and realizes all the necessary steps on the Alfresco site without actually transporting /managing documents to / in the external repository.
